    "# Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this notebook is to evaluate all the different models. For this project we are going to use several different evaluation metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Histogram and see if the proportion of groud truth and prediction is consistent\n",
    "2. Build confusion matrix\n",
    "3. Calculate F1 score, Precision, Recall (most important)\n",
    "4. Decil plots\n",
    "\n",
    "The Recall metric is one of the most important ones as it will tell us out of all the frauds how many we detected. This is crucial in this kind of problems as it is more painful for a bank to not detect a fraud, than to flag a transaction as fraudulent and in the end not being.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decil plots will also be useful to see which are the most important decils and the model is most confident on, and how it the model behaves on each section"
